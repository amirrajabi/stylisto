# Task ID: 5
# Title: Supabase Integration and Authentication Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Supabase for backend services and implement authentication functionality including email/password and OAuth providers.
# Details:
Set up Supabase project and configure authentication providers (email/password, Google, Apple). Implement authentication service layer in the application to handle user registration, login, logout, and password reset. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data protection. Implement token management for authentication persistence. Create error handling for authentication failures. Set up email templates for verification and password reset. Use Supabase JS client v2+ for optimal performance and type safety with TypeScript. Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete authentication flows including registration, login, and password reset. Verify OAuth providers connect successfully. Test token persistence across app restarts. Validate error handling for various authentication failure scenarios. Verify RLS policies correctly restrict data access.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Supabase Project and Configure Database [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Supabase project, configure the database, and connect it to the React Native/Expo app.
### Details:
Create a Supabase project via the dashboard. Obtain the project URL and anon/public keys. Integrate the Supabase client SDK into the React Native/Expo app. Test the connection by making a simple API call.

## 2. Enable and Configure Authentication Providers [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Set up and enable desired authentication providers (email/password, OAuth, magic link, etc.) in the Supabase dashboard.
### Details:
Navigate to Authentication → Providers in the Supabase dashboard. Enable required providers (e.g., Google, Apple, GitHub, email/password). Configure provider-specific settings such as client IDs and secrets. Test provider login flows in the dashboard.

## 3. Design and Implement Auth Service Layer in React Native/Expo [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create a dedicated authentication service layer to abstract Supabase auth logic and expose clean methods for sign up, login, logout, and session management.
### Details:
Implement a TypeScript/JavaScript service module that wraps Supabase Auth SDK methods. Expose functions for sign up, sign in, sign out, password reset, and session retrieval. Ensure all methods return consistent results and handle errors gracefully.

## 4. Set Up Row Level Security (RLS) Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Define and apply RLS policies in Supabase to restrict data access based on authenticated user roles and ownership.
### Details:
Use the Supabase SQL Editor to write RLS policies for each relevant table. Ensure policies check for authenticated users and enforce ownership or role-based access. Test policies using the Supabase dashboard and client queries.

## 5. Implement Token Management and Secure Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Handle JWT access and refresh tokens securely in the React Native/Expo app, using best practices for mobile token storage.
### Details:
Use secure storage libraries (e.g., expo-secure-store) to store tokens. Implement logic to retrieve, refresh, and clear tokens as needed. Ensure tokens are never exposed in logs or insecure storage.

## 6. Implement Robust Error Handling for Auth Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling for all authentication flows, including user feedback and logging.
### Details:
Handle and display user-friendly error messages for common auth errors (invalid credentials, network issues, etc.). Log unexpected errors for debugging. Ensure error handling is consistent across all auth service methods.

## 7. Set Up and Integrate Custom Email Templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Configure and customize email templates for authentication-related emails (confirmation, password reset, etc.) in Supabase.
### Details:
In the Supabase dashboard, navigate to Authentication → Templates. Customize templates for sign up confirmation, password reset, and magic link emails. Test email delivery and rendering with real user flows.

## 8. Implement Refresh Token Rotation and Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5
### Description: Set up refresh token rotation to enhance security and manage user sessions effectively.
### Details:
Configure Supabase to use refresh token rotation if supported. Update the auth service layer to handle token refresh and session renewal. Ensure the app gracefully handles expired tokens and prompts users to re-authenticate if needed.
