# Task ID: 17
# Title: Push Notification System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 16
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement push notification functionality for daily outfit suggestions and user engagement.
# Details:
Integrate Expo Notifications for cross-platform push delivery as specified in the PRD. Implement notification permission requesting with clear explanations. Create notification scheduling system for daily outfit suggestions. Implement user preference management for notification types and timing. Add deep linking from notifications to specific app screens. Create notification content generation for outfit suggestions. Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging as backup service where needed. Use proper error handling for notification failures. Consider implementing local notifications as fallback when push services are unavailable.

# Test Strategy:
Test notification delivery on both iOS and Android devices. Verify deep linking navigates to correct screens. Test permission flows for both granted and denied scenarios. Validate notification preferences are respected. Test notification content displays correctly on different devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Expo Notifications API [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure Expo Notifications in the React Native project, ensuring compatibility with both iOS and Android platforms.
### Details:
Install the Expo Notifications package, configure the app.json/app.config.js for push notification support, and initialize the Notifications API in the app entry point following Expo and React Native best practices.

## 2. Implement Permission Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Request and manage notification permissions from users, handling all possible permission states and errors.
### Details:
Use Expo's Notifications API to prompt users for notification permissions, handle user responses, and gracefully manage denied or restricted permissions. Store permission status for future reference.

## 3. Develop Notification Scheduling Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Enable scheduling of local and remote notifications based on user actions or app events.
### Details:
Implement functions to schedule, update, and cancel notifications using Expo's Notifications API. Support both one-time and recurring notifications, and ensure correct behavior across app states (foreground, background, terminated).

## 4. Build User Preference Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Create a system for users to manage their notification preferences within the app.
### Details:
Design UI components for notification settings, persist user preferences (e.g., enable/disable types of notifications, quiet hours), and ensure notification logic respects these preferences at all times.

## 5. Implement Deep Linking from Notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Configure deep linking so that tapping a notification navigates users to the appropriate screen or content within the app.
### Details:
Set up React Navigation's linking configuration, handle notification response events, and route users to the correct screens with relevant parameters when a notification is tapped.

## 6. Establish Backup and Fallback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5
### Description: Ensure robust notification delivery and user experience by implementing backup and fallback strategies.
### Details:
Implement local notification fallbacks if remote delivery fails, handle edge cases such as permission revocation or device offline states, and provide user feedback or logs for troubleshooting.
