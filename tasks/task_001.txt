# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Development Environment Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the React Native project with Expo managed workflow, configure TypeScript, and set up the development environment with necessary dependencies.
# Details:
Create a new React Native project using Expo CLI with TypeScript template. Install essential dependencies including React Navigation v6, state management libraries (Redux Toolkit and React Query), UI component libraries (React Native Paper), and development tools. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Set up the project structure following the layer separation principle outlined in the PRD (Frontend UI/UX, Frontend Logic, Backend API, Database). Create documentation for development setup and contribution guidelines. Use Expo SDK 48+ for the latest features and compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully without errors. Confirm TypeScript configuration is working properly. Test that all installed dependencies are compatible and functioning. Ensure development environment can be reproduced by other team members following the documentation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Expo Project with TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Expo project using the TypeScript template to ensure type safety and modern development practices.
### Details:
Run `npx create-expo-app@latest <project-name>` and select the TypeScript template. Confirm project creation and navigate into the new directory.

## 2. Configure TypeScript Settings [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Verify and adjust TypeScript configuration for optimal compatibility with Expo and React Native.
### Details:
Check the generated `tsconfig.json` for recommended compiler options. Update paths, strictness, and module resolution as needed for your team's standards.

## 3. Install Essential Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add navigation, state management, and UI libraries required for the project.
### Details:
Install packages such as `@react-navigation/native`, `@react-navigation/stack`, `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, a state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit or Zustand), and a UI library (e.g., NativeBase or React Native Paper) using npm or yarn.

## 4. Set Up ESLint and Prettier [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure code quality and formatting tools to enforce consistent coding standards.
### Details:
Install ESLint and Prettier along with recommended plugins for React Native and TypeScript. Create `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc` files with project-specific rules. Add lint and format scripts to `package.json`.

## 5. Establish Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Organize the project directory into logical folders for scalability and maintainability.
### Details:
Create directories such as `/src`, `/src/components`, `/src/screens`, `/src/navigation`, `/src/store`, and `/src/utils`. Move initial files into the appropriate locations and update import paths.

## 6. Write Setup and Contribution Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Document the setup process, project structure, and contribution guidelines for team onboarding.
### Details:
Create a `README.md` with step-by-step setup instructions, dependency explanations, project structure overview, and contribution best practices. Include commands for running, linting, and formatting the project.

## 7. Verify Environment Reproducibility [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test the setup process on a clean machine to ensure all steps work and the environment is reproducible.
### Details:
Clone the repository on a different system, follow the documentation to set up the project, and confirm that the app runs, lints, and formats as expected. Update documentation if any issues are found.
