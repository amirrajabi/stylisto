# Task ID: 21
# Title: Internationalization and Content Externalization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement text content externalization and prepare the application for future internationalization.
# Details:
Create JSON resource files for all user-facing text strings. Implement i18n framework (i18next or similar) for content management. Remove hardcoded text from React Native components. Organize content by feature and context. Implement right-to-left (RTL) layout support for future language additions. Add language selection infrastructure (for future use). Create content versioning and update mechanisms. Document content management workflows. Consider implementing pluralization support for numeric content.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all user-facing text comes from externalized resources. Test RTL layout support with forced RTL mode. Validate content updates can be applied without app updates. Test with pseudo-localization to identify hardcoded strings. Verify content organization is logical and maintainable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Resource Files for Supported Languages [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up structured JSON files for each supported language (e.g., en.json, fr.json) using semantic keys and grouping translations by app structure (components, screens, utils).
### Details:
Follow best practices by using semantic keys (e.g., action.confirm) and maintaining context. Place files in a dedicated /locales or /i18n directory. Populate with initial translations for all UI text.

## 2. Set Up i18n Framework with Expo and React Native [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Install and configure an i18n library (e.g., react-native-i18n or i18next) to load and manage translations, handle locale detection, and provide translation functions throughout the app.
### Details:
Install the chosen library via npm/yarn. Configure fallback languages, load resource files, and set up locale detection using device settings. Ensure integration with Expo and React Native best practices.

## 3. Remove Hardcoded Text from Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Refactor all UI components to replace hardcoded strings with calls to the i18n translation function, ensuring all user-facing text is sourced from resource files.
### Details:
Systematically audit all components and screens. Replace static text with translation keys (e.g., I18n.t('greeting')). Test to confirm all text renders correctly from translations.

## 4. Implement RTL (Right-to-Left) Language Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Enable and test RTL layout support for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, ensuring UI adapts correctly and all mirrored elements function as expected.
### Details:
Use React Native's I18nManager to enable RTL. Adjust styles and layouts where necessary. Test with RTL languages to verify correct alignment, mirroring, and text direction.

## 5. Build Language Selection Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Create UI and logic to allow users to select their preferred language, update the app locale dynamically, and persist the selection across sessions.
### Details:
Implement a language picker component. Update the i18n library's locale on selection. Store user preference using AsyncStorage or SecureStore. Ensure the app reloads translations immediately after selection.

## 6. Document i18n Implementation and Maintenance [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3, 21.4, 21.5
### Description: Write comprehensive documentation covering resource file structure, i18n setup, translation workflow, RTL support, and language selection for future developers.
### Details:
Include code examples, best practices, and instructions for adding new languages or updating translations. Document testing procedures for different locales and RTL support.
