# Task ID: 20
# Title: Accessibility Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 7, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the application meets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards for accessibility.
# Details:
Implement proper semantic markup for screen reader compatibility. Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate accessibility labels. Add support for dynamic text sizing. Implement high contrast mode for visually impaired users. Ensure color contrast meets minimum standards (4.5:1 for normal text). Add keyboard navigation support where applicable. Implement focus management for modal dialogs. Create accessibility documentation for developers. Use React Native's accessibility API consistently throughout the application. Consider implementing voice control compatibility where platform-supported.

# Test Strategy:
Test with screen readers on both iOS and Android. Verify all interactive elements are properly labeled. Test dynamic text sizing at different scales. Validate color contrast using accessibility tools. Test keyboard navigation where applicable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Semantic Markup Using Accessibility Roles [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply appropriate accessibilityRole props (e.g., 'header', 'button', 'link') to all interactive and structural components to provide semantic meaning for assistive technologies.
### Details:
Review all UI components and assign correct accessibilityRole values according to their function. Ensure headers, buttons, and other elements are properly identified for screen readers.

## 2. Add Accessibility Labels and Hints [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Provide descriptive accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint props for all actionable and informative UI elements to improve screen reader support.
### Details:
Audit all interactive elements (buttons, links, images, etc.) and supply clear, concise labels and hints. Ensure that labels are meaningful and not redundant with visible text.

## 3. Enable Dynamic Text Sizing Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Ensure all text components respond to user font size preferences by using scalable units and enabling allowFontScaling where appropriate.
### Details:
Replace fixed font sizes with scalable units (e.g., using StyleSheet and PixelRatio). Set allowFontScaling={true} on all <Text> components and test with device accessibility settings.

## 4. Implement High Contrast Mode Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Detect and adapt to system high contrast mode settings, updating color schemes and UI elements for optimal visibility.
### Details:
Use Appearance API or AccessibilityInfo to detect high contrast mode. Adjust styles and color palettes dynamically to meet high contrast requirements.

## 5. Perform Color Contrast Checks and Adjust Palette [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4
### Description: Audit all color combinations for sufficient contrast and update styles to meet WCAG AA/AAA guidelines.
### Details:
Use automated tools or libraries to check color contrast ratios. Refactor color usage in stylesheets to ensure compliance, especially for text and interactive elements.

## 6. Implement Keyboard Navigation for All Interactive Elements [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Ensure all actionable UI elements are accessible and operable via keyboard navigation, including tab order and activation.
### Details:
Set accessible={true} and accessibilityRole on interactive elements. Test navigation using hardware keyboards and ensure logical tab order.

## 7. Manage Focus Programmatically for Dynamic Content [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement focus management strategies to move focus appropriately when UI changes, such as after navigation or dynamic updates.
### Details:
Use AccessibilityInfo and refs to programmatically set focus on relevant elements after navigation or content updates. Ensure focus is never lost or trapped.

## 8. Document Accessibility Features and Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation detailing implemented accessibility features, usage guidelines, and testing procedures for future maintainers.
### Details:
Write clear documentation covering semantic markup, labels, dynamic text, high contrast, color contrast, keyboard navigation, and focus management. Include code examples and testing instructions.
