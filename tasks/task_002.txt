# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive design system based on the PRD's visual design specifications, including color palette, typography, spacing, and component styles.
# Details:
Implement a design system using React Native's StyleSheet or a styling library like styled-components. Define color constants according to the PRD's color palette (#2D3748 for primary, #4299E1 for secondary, etc.). Create typography styles for different text hierarchies using system fonts (San Francisco for iOS, Roboto for Android). Implement spacing system with consistent values. Create reusable UI components including buttons, form inputs, cards, and modals following the minimalist aesthetic described in the PRD. Ensure components are accessible with proper contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1) and touch targets (minimum 44px). Document the design system for team reference.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all UI components render correctly across different device sizes. Test color contrast using accessibility tools to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Confirm typography scales appropriately on different devices. Validate touch targets meet minimum size requirements for accessibility.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Color Palette [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a scalable and accessible color palette for the design system, including primary, secondary, background, surface, and semantic colors (success, warning, error). Ensure color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards.
### Details:
Document color tokens and provide usage guidelines for light and dark modes. Use Expo and React Native best practices for color management.

## 2. Set Up Typography System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define font families, sizes, weights, and line heights for headings, body text, captions, and other text elements. Create a typography scale and document usage.
### Details:
Implement typography tokens and reusable text components. Ensure text is legible and accessible across devices.

## 3. Create Spacing and Sizing System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a consistent spacing and sizing system using tokens for margins, paddings, and element sizes. Document spacing scale and usage patterns.
### Details:
Implement spacing utilities and ensure consistency across components. Follow React Native best practices for responsive design.

## 4. Build Reusable UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Develop a library of reusable components such as buttons, inputs, cards, and modals. Ensure components are customizable and follow the defined design tokens.
### Details:
Abstract common UI patterns, use prop-driven customization, and ensure components are platform-consistent. Write unit tests for each component.

## 5. Implement Accessibility Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Ensure all components meet accessibility standards, including color contrast, touch target sizes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
### Details:
Test components with accessibility tools and document compliance. Address accessibility issues early in the component development process.

## 6. Document the Design System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the design system, including guidelines for color, typography, spacing, component usage, and accessibility.
### Details:
Use tools like Storybook or Expo documentation to provide live examples and code snippets. Ensure documentation is clear and easy to maintain.

## 7. Integrate Design System with App [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
### Description: Integrate the design system into the main application codebase. Replace legacy styles and components with the new system.
### Details:
Coordinate with development teams to ensure smooth adoption. Provide migration guides and support.

## 8. Establish Maintenance and Contribution Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.6, 2.7
### Description: Set up processes for maintaining, updating, and extending the design system. Define contribution guidelines and review procedures.
### Details:
Implement version control, changelogs, and CI/CD pipelines for the design system. Encourage feedback and continuous improvement.
