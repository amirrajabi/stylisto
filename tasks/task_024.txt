# Task ID: 24
# Title: Comprehensive Testing Suite Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5, 12, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
# Details:
Implement unit testing framework (Jest) for component and utility testing. Add integration tests for critical user flows. Create end-to-end testing using Detox or similar framework. Implement visual regression testing for UI components. Add performance testing for critical operations. Create automated accessibility testing. Implement continuous integration with GitHub Actions. Add test coverage reporting and minimum coverage requirements. Use mock services for API-dependent tests. Consider implementing snapshot testing for UI components.

# Test Strategy:
Verify test coverage meets minimum requirements (>80% as specified in PRD). Test critical user flows with integration tests. Validate end-to-end tests run successfully on CI environment. Test performance meets specified requirements. Verify accessibility tests identify compliance issues.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Unit Testing Environment with Jest and jest-expo [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure Jest and jest-expo for the React Native/Expo project, ensuring the base configuration is set up in package.json.
### Details:
Run 'npx expo install jest-expo jest @types/jest --dev' and update package.json with the appropriate Jest preset and test script as per Expo documentation.

## 2. Implement Unit Tests for Components and Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Write unit tests for individual components and utility functions using Jest and React Native Testing Library, focusing on user-centric scenarios.
### Details:
Create test files (e.g., ComponentName.test.tsx) and use @testing-library/react-native to simulate user interactions and assert expected outcomes, avoiding implementation detail testing.

## 3. Set Up and Write Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Configure and implement integration tests to verify interactions between multiple components or modules.
### Details:
Identify key integration points (e.g., form submission, navigation flows), write tests that cover these scenarios, and use mocks/stubs as needed.

## 4. Configure and Implement End-to-End (E2E) Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Set up an E2E testing framework (such as Detox) and write tests that simulate real user flows through the app.
### Details:
Install Detox, configure it for Expo, and write E2E tests that launch the app, perform user actions, and verify outcomes across screens.

## 5. Integrate Visual Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Set up a visual regression testing tool to capture and compare UI snapshots, detecting unintended visual changes.
### Details:
Choose a tool (e.g., Loki or Percy), configure it with the project, and add baseline snapshots for key screens/components.

## 6. Implement Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Add performance testing to monitor and assert app performance metrics during development and CI runs.
### Details:
Integrate tools or scripts to measure app startup time, render times, and memory usage, and set up thresholds for alerts.

## 7. Add Accessibility Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Integrate accessibility testing tools to ensure the app meets accessibility standards and guidelines.
### Details:
Use libraries such as @testing-library/react-native's accessibility queries and/or axe-core/react-native-axe to automate accessibility checks in tests.

## 8. Integrate Testing Suite with CI and Enable Coverage Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2, 24.3, 24.4, 24.5, 24.6, 24.7
### Description: Configure the CI pipeline to run all tests (unit, integration, E2E, visual, performance, accessibility) and generate coverage reports.
### Details:
Update CI configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI) to install dependencies, run all test suites, and upload coverage reports to a service like Coveralls or Codecov.
