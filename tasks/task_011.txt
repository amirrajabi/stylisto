# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Tag Editing UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main user interface for editing tags, including displaying existing tags and providing controls for editing. Ensure the UI follows React Native and Expo best practices, supports inline editing, and is visually intuitive.
### Details:
Use React Native components such as <View>, <Text>, and <TouchableOpacity> to structure the UI. Implement inline editing using state management to toggle between display and edit modes for each tag. Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.

## 2. Enable Custom Tag Addition and Removal [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement functionality to allow users to add new custom tags and remove existing ones dynamically from the UI.
### Details:
Provide an input field for adding new tags and a remove button/icon for each tag. Validate input to prevent duplicates and empty tags. Update the tag list state accordingly and ensure smooth UI updates.

## 3. Integrate Color Selection for Tags [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Allow users to select a color for each tag, either during creation or editing, using a color picker or predefined palette.
### Details:
Implement a color picker component or a set of selectable color swatches. Store the selected color in the tag's data and update the tag's appearance in the UI to reflect the chosen color.

## 4. Implement Style Attribute Selection for Tags [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Provide options for users to select style attributes (e.g., bold, italic, underline) for individual tags.
### Details:
Add UI controls (such as toggle buttons) for style attributes. Update the tag's style state and apply the selected styles using React Native's <Text> component styling.

## 5. Add Season Tagging Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Enable users to tag items with one or more seasons (e.g., Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) as part of the tag editing process.
### Details:
Provide a set of selectable season tags, either as checkboxes or toggle buttons. Store selected seasons in the tag's data and display them alongside other tag attributes.

## 6. Implement Feedback Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Add real-time feedback for user actions such as successful tag addition/removal, invalid input, or errors.
### Details:
Display feedback messages using Toasts, Snackbars, or inline error messages. Ensure feedback is clear, timely, and accessible. Handle edge cases such as duplicate tags or invalid color/style selections.
