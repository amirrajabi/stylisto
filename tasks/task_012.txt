# Task ID: 12
# Title: Outfit Generation Algorithm Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core algorithm for generating outfit recommendations based on clothing items, occasions, and style preferences.
# Details:
Implement outfit generation logic that considers clothing categories, colors, styles, and occasions. Create color coordination rules based on color theory (complementary, analogous, etc.). Implement style matching algorithms to ensure consistent outfit aesthetics. Add occasion-appropriate filtering (formal, casual, work, etc.). Create weather-appropriate recommendations using external weather data. Implement logical outfit composition to avoid incompatible combinations. Add variety mechanisms to prevent repetitive suggestions. Use efficient algorithms to ensure generation completes within 3 seconds as specified in the PRD. Consider implementing a rule-based system with weighted scoring for flexibility and performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test outfit generation with various wardrobe compositions. Verify color coordination follows established color theory principles. Test style matching across different categories. Validate occasion-appropriate filtering returns suitable items. Test performance to ensure generation completes within specified time limits.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Logic for Outfit Recommendation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the main algorithm that generates outfit recommendations based on user wardrobe, preferences, and constraints.
### Details:
Design and implement a modular, testable core logic layer that can process wardrobe data, user preferences, and contextual inputs to output recommended outfits. Ensure the logic is decoupled from UI and follows React Native best practices for maintainability and scalability.

## 2. Develop Color Coordination Rules Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a rules engine to assess and score color combinations for outfit pieces.
### Details:
Define color harmony rules (e.g., complementary, analogous, monochromatic) and implement logic to evaluate and score outfit color combinations. Integrate with the core logic to filter or rank outfits based on color compatibility.

## 3. Implement Style Matching Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Build logic to ensure stylistic coherence among outfit components.
### Details:
Define style categories (e.g., casual, formal, sporty) and implement matching rules to ensure outfit pieces align in style. Use tags or metadata on wardrobe items and integrate style checks into the recommendation pipeline.

## 4. Add Occasion Filtering Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.3
### Description: Enable filtering and prioritization of outfits based on the selected occasion.
### Details:
Define a set of occasions (e.g., work, party, gym) and map wardrobe items to suitable occasions. Implement filtering logic in the core algorithm to only recommend outfits appropriate for the selected occasion.

## 5. Integrate Weather Data and Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Fetch and utilize weather data to influence outfit recommendations.
### Details:
Integrate a weather API to retrieve current and forecasted weather. Implement logic to adjust outfit recommendations based on temperature, precipitation, and other relevant weather factors (e.g., suggest layers or waterproof items).

## 6. Compose Outfit Assembly Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Develop logic to assemble complete outfits from individual wardrobe items.
### Details:
Implement algorithms to combine tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories into cohesive outfits, ensuring all constraints (color, style, occasion, weather) are satisfied. Optimize for modularity and extensibility.

## 7. Design Variety and Rotation Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure outfit recommendations offer variety and avoid repetition.
### Details:
Implement mechanisms to track outfit history and introduce logic to prioritize underused items or combinations. Add randomness or rotation algorithms to maximize wardrobe utilization and user satisfaction.

## 8. Optimize Performance and Scalability [done]
### Dependencies: 12.6, 12.7
### Description: Profile and optimize the recommendation engine for speed and scalability.
### Details:
Identify performance bottlenecks in the recommendation pipeline. Apply memoization, batching, or asynchronous processing as needed. Ensure the logic is efficient for large wardrobes and responsive on both iOS and Android, following React Native and Expo best practices.
