# Task ID: 10
# Title: AI Clothing Analysis Service Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate with AI services for automatic clothing categorization, color detection, and style attribute recognition.
# Details:
Research and select optimal AI service for clothing analysis (Google Cloud Vision AI recommended based on PRD). Implement service integration for image analysis with proper error handling and rate limiting. Create mapping logic to transform AI responses into application-specific categories and attributes. Implement confidence scoring for AI predictions. Add fallback categorization for unrecognized items. Create batch processing capability for multiple items. Implement caching strategy to avoid redundant API calls. Use the latest version of the Vision API (v1p4beta1 or newer) for access to advanced features like product recognition.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI analysis with diverse clothing items across different categories. Verify color detection accuracy with various lighting conditions. Test attribute recognition for different styles and patterns. Validate confidence scoring reflects actual accuracy. Test fallback mechanisms when AI service fails or returns low confidence results.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Select AI Services [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and evaluate suitable AI service providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google Cloud AI, AWS) based on project requirements, pricing, reliability, and available SDKs for React Native and Expo.
### Details:
Compare features, latency, cost, and SDK support. Document the rationale for the chosen service(s).

## 2. Set Up API Keys and Environment Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Securely obtain API keys for the selected AI services and configure them in the project using environment variables compatible with Expo and React Native.
### Details:
Create a local .env file, add API keys, and ensure they are not committed to version control. Update app.json or other config files as needed for Expo.

## 3. Integrate AI Service APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Implement API integration for the selected AI services using recommended SDKs or REST endpoints, ensuring compatibility with React Native and Expo.
### Details:
Install necessary SDKs (e.g., openai, google generative ai), handle polyfills for Expo, and set up API request/response logic.

## 4. Map AI Responses to App Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Design and implement logic to parse and map AI service responses into the app's data structures and UI components.
### Details:
Define response schemas, handle edge cases, and ensure robust error handling for unpredictable or malformed responses.

## 5. Implement Confidence Scoring Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Extract and utilize confidence scores from AI responses (if available) or design a custom scoring system to assess response reliability.
### Details:
Display confidence levels in the UI and use them to inform downstream logic (e.g., fallback, user alerts).

## 6. Develop Fallback Logic for Unreliable Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Create fallback strategies for handling low-confidence or failed AI responses, such as retrying, switching providers, or showing user-friendly error messages.
### Details:
Implement logic to trigger fallback actions based on confidence thresholds or error types.

## 7. Enable Batch Processing of AI Requests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement batch processing to handle multiple AI requests efficiently, minimizing API calls and optimizing performance.
### Details:
Group requests where possible, manage concurrency, and ensure results are mapped back to the correct UI elements.

## 8. Implement Caching and Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add caching mechanisms to store recent AI responses and implement rate limiting to comply with API quotas and prevent overuse.
### Details:
Use in-memory or persistent storage for caching, and integrate rate limiting logic at the API call layer. Ensure Expo/React Native best practices for performance.
