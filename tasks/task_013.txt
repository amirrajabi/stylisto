# Task ID: 13
# Title: Outfit Recommendation UI Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the user interface for displaying outfit recommendations, including occasion selection and outfit visualization.
# Details:
Create occasion selection interface with visual category representations. Design outfit display layout showing top, bottom, shoes, and accessories. Implement styling description area for AI-generated text. Add action buttons for saving, refreshing, and sharing outfits. Create loading states for generation process. Implement swipe or carousel interaction for browsing multiple recommendations. Add visual indicators for weather appropriateness. Design empty states for insufficient wardrobe items. Use React Native's Image component with proper caching for optimal performance. Consider implementing react-native-reanimated for smooth animations during outfit transitions.

# Test Strategy:
Test occasion selection interface with all available options. Verify outfit display renders correctly with different item combinations. Test action buttons for expected functionality. Validate responsive layout on different screen sizes. Test performance with multiple recommendation options.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Occasion Selection UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user interface component that allows users to select an occasion (e.g., work, casual, party) using buttons, dropdowns, or chips, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness.
### Details:
Implement using React Native components such as TouchableOpacity or Pressable for selection. Use state management (e.g., useState or Redux) to track the selected occasion. Follow Expo best practices for cross-platform compatibility.

## 2. Implement Outfit Display Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop a visually appealing layout to display outfit items, including images, names, and key details, adapting to various screen sizes.
### Details:
Use FlatList or ScrollView for efficient rendering of outfit items. Apply responsive styling with StyleSheet or Tailwind CSS. Ensure images are optimized and use Expo's Image component for performance.

## 3. Build Styling Description Area [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Create a section that provides detailed styling descriptions, tips, or rationale for the selected outfit, supporting dynamic content updates.
### Details:
Use a dedicated View with Text components for descriptions. Support multiline text and dynamic updates based on selected occasion or outfit. Ensure accessibility with proper font sizes and contrast.

## 4. Add Action Buttons [done]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Integrate interactive action buttons (e.g., Save, Share, Refresh) with clear feedback and accessibility support.
### Details:
Use React Native's Button or TouchableOpacity components. Implement onPress handlers for each action. Provide visual feedback (e.g., loading spinners, disabled states) and ensure buttons are accessible with proper labels.

Fixed critical infinite loop bug in the OutfitEditModal component that was affecting the action buttons functionality:

- Identified root cause: useEffect dependency on recalculateScore callback which included calculateOutfitScore in its dependencies
- The calculateOutfitScore function was being recreated on every render, causing infinite loop
- This triggered "Maximum update depth exceeded" error when users attempted to edit outfits
- Modified useEffect to depend directly on editedItems instead of recalculateScore
- Implemented proper null handling for empty editedItems array
- Updated Typography.body.xsmall references to Typography.body.small to resolve linter errors
- Verified that outfit action buttons now work correctly without triggering infinite rendering
- Ensured score recalculation still functions properly when items change
- Eliminated React warnings and crashes related to the edit functionality

## 5. Handle Loading States [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Implement loading indicators and skeleton screens for asynchronous data fetching and UI transitions.
### Details:
Use ActivityIndicator or custom skeleton components to indicate loading. Display placeholders while fetching outfit data, weather info, or images. Ensure smooth transitions and avoid layout shifts.

## 6. Implement Carousel/Swipe Interaction [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Enable users to swipe or scroll through multiple outfit options using a performant carousel or swipeable list.
### Details:
Use libraries like react-native-snap-carousel or FlatList with horizontal scrolling. Support smooth swipe gestures, snapping, and lazy loading of items for performance. Ensure accessibility for swipe actions.

## 7. Integrate Weather Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Display real-time weather indicators (e.g., temperature, icon, condition) that update based on location and time.
### Details:
Fetch weather data using an API (e.g., OpenWeather). Display weather icons, temperature, and conditions using styled components. Dynamically update UI based on weather changes, following best practices for API calls and error handling.
