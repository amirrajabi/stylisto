# Task ID: 22
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance for image loading, list rendering, and overall responsiveness.
# Details:
Implement image caching and optimization using expo-image. Add lazy loading for off-screen content. Optimize list rendering with FlatList virtualization. Implement memoization for expensive computations. Add progressive loading for large datasets. Create performance monitoring for key operations. Optimize Redux state management to prevent unnecessary renders. Implement code splitting and dynamic imports where applicable. Consider using Hermes JavaScript engine for improved performance on Android.

# Test Strategy:
Measure and compare performance metrics before and after optimization. Test scrolling performance with large datasets. Verify image loading times are acceptable on various devices. Test memory usage during extended app usage. Validate app responsiveness during resource-intensive operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Image Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate an image caching solution to reduce redundant network requests and improve image load times in the app.
### Details:
Refactor image components to use expo-image for caching and optimization, ensuring full Expo compatibility. Test image loading performance and fallback behavior.

## 2. Enable Lazy Loading for Images and Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical components to defer their loading until they are needed.
### Details:
Use React.lazy and Suspense for component-level lazy loading. For images, implement logic to load images only when they enter the viewport (e.g., using onLayout or third-party libraries). Ensure smooth user experience with loading placeholders.

## 3. Integrate List Virtualization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize rendering of large lists using virtualization techniques to improve memory usage and scroll performance.
### Details:
Replace standard ScrollView or ListView with FlatList or SectionList for large data sets. Configure getItemLayout, initialNumToRender, and windowSize props for optimal performance. Test with large datasets to verify smooth scrolling.

## 4. Apply Memoization Techniques [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Reduce unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and functions where appropriate.
### Details:
Identify components and functions that are frequently re-rendered. Use React.memo for functional components and useCallback/useMemo hooks for functions and computed values. Profile the app to confirm reduced re-render counts.

## 5. Implement Progressive Loading Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2
### Description: Introduce progressive loading for images and data to enhance perceived performance and user experience.
### Details:
Display low-resolution image placeholders or skeleton loaders while high-resolution images/data are loading. Gradually replace placeholders with actual content as it becomes available. Ensure transitions are smooth and visually appealing.

## 6. Set Up Performance Monitoring and Profiling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate tools and practices for ongoing performance monitoring and profiling to identify and address bottlenecks.
### Details:
Enable React Native Performance Monitor and integrate third-party tools like Flipper or React Native Debugger. Set up custom performance metrics using console.time and console.timeEnd. Establish a routine for profiling during development and before releases.

## 7. Implement Code Splitting and Dynamic Imports [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Split code into smaller bundles and load them dynamically to reduce initial load time and improve responsiveness.
### Details:
Identify large or infrequently used modules suitable for code splitting. Use dynamic imports and React.lazy to load these modules on demand. Test the impact on bundle size and initial load performance, ensuring compatibility with Expo's bundler.
