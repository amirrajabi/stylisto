# Task ID: 4
# Title: User Authentication UI Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the user interface for authentication flows including registration, login, and password reset screens.
# Details:
Create UI components for email/password registration with real-time validation feedback. Implement social login buttons for Google and Apple authentication. Design password reset flow UI with email input and confirmation screens. Implement form validation with clear error messaging. Create loading states for authentication actions. Design the onboarding flow UI that follows successful authentication. Use Formik or React Hook Form for form state management and validation. Implement secure input fields for password entry with show/hide functionality. Ensure all authentication screens follow the design system guidelines.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation for all input fields. Verify error messages display correctly for invalid inputs. Test UI responsiveness across different device sizes. Validate accessibility of all form elements. Test navigation between authentication screens.

# Subtasks:

## 6. Handle Loading and Error States Across Authentication Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Implement loading indicators and error state handling for all authentication-related screens and actions.
### Details:
Show spinners during network requests, display concise error messages, and provide retry options for failed actions. Use error codes for troubleshooting.

## 7. Build Onboarding Flow and Accessibility Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6
### Description: Create an onboarding flow for new users and perform accessibility checks on all authentication screens.
