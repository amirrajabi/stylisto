# Task ID: 7
# Title: Wardrobe Management UI Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the user interface for the wardrobe management feature, including clothing item grid, filtering, and search functionality.
# Details:
Create a grid/list view toggle for wardrobe display with responsive layouts. Implement category filtering options (tops, bottoms, shoes, etc.) with visual indicators. Design search functionality with real-time filtering. Create item detail view with tag display and editing capabilities. Implement empty state designs for new users. Add loading states and pagination for large wardrobes. Use React Native FlatList with optimizations for smooth scrolling and memory efficiency. Implement image caching using expo-image for performance optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Test grid and list views with various numbers of clothing items. Verify filtering and search functionality returns correct results. Test responsive layout on different screen sizes. Validate performance with large numbers of items. Test accessibility of all interactive elements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Grid/List View Toggle [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a UI component that allows users to switch between grid and list views for displaying items, ensuring responsive layouts and accessibility.
### Details:
Use React Native FlatList for both views. Implement a toggle button in the header. Ensure consistent item rendering and spacing in both modes. Follow Expo and React Native best practices for performance.

## 2. Develop Filtering Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a filtering system that enables users to filter items based on predefined categories or attributes.
### Details:
Design filter UI (e.g., dropdowns, chips). Implement filter logic to update the displayed item list. Ensure filters work seamlessly with both grid and list views.

## 3. Implement Search Capability [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Add a search bar that allows users to search items by keywords, updating the displayed list in real-time.
### Details:
Use a controlled TextInput for search. Debounce input to optimize performance. Integrate search logic with filtering and pagination.

## 4. Build Item Detail View [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a detailed view for each item, accessible from the grid/list, displaying comprehensive information and images.
### Details:
Implement navigation to detail view using React Navigation. Display all relevant item data and images. Ensure back navigation and deep linking support.

## 5. Handle Empty and Loading States [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Design and implement UI states for when data is loading or when no items match the current filters/search.
### Details:
Show activity indicators during data fetch. Display informative empty state messages with optional actions (e.g., clear filters). Ensure accessibility compliance.

## 6. Implement Pagination [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.5
### Description: Add pagination to efficiently load and display large datasets, supporting both infinite scroll and page-based navigation.
### Details:
Use FlatList's onEndReached for infinite scroll or implement page controls. Manage loading indicators for paginated fetches. Integrate with filtering and search logic.

## 7. Integrate Image Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.4
### Description: Optimize image loading and caching for performance and offline support using recommended libraries.
### Details:
Use expo-image for image components. Preload images where appropriate. Test cache behavior on both iOS and Android. Follow Expo compatibility guidelines.
