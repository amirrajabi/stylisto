# Task ID: 14
# Title: OpenAI Integration for Outfit Descriptions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate with OpenAI API to generate natural language descriptions and styling tips for outfit recommendations.
# Details:
Implement OpenAI API integration using GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 as specified in the PRD. Create prompt engineering for consistent, helpful styling advice. Implement caching for frequently generated descriptions to optimize costs. Add rate limiting and error handling for API failures. Create fallback descriptions for when API is unavailable. Implement context-aware prompts that include outfit details, occasion, and style information. Use the latest OpenAI API version with proper authentication and error handling. Consider implementing streaming responses for faster initial display.

# Test Strategy:
Test description generation with various outfit combinations. Verify descriptions are contextually relevant to the specific outfit. Test caching mechanism reduces API calls for similar outfits. Validate fallback descriptions provide useful information when API fails. Test response time meets the 2-second requirement specified in the PRD.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up OpenAI API Integration in Expo React Native [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install necessary dependencies, configure environment variables, and securely store the OpenAI API key for use in the Expo React Native project.
### Details:
Follow Expo and OpenAI SDK documentation to install packages, set up .env files, and ensure the API key is not exposed in the client code. Test connectivity with a simple API call.

## 2. Implement Prompt Engineering Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Design and implement utility functions for constructing, formatting, and managing prompts sent to the OpenAI API.
### Details:
Create reusable functions to build prompts, inject system/user roles, and allow for dynamic prompt customization. Ensure prompts are clear, concise, and optimized for intended AI behavior.

## 3. Add Caching Layer for API Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Implement a caching mechanism to store and retrieve recent API responses, reducing redundant calls and managing costs.
### Details:
Use in-memory or persistent storage (e.g., AsyncStorage) to cache responses based on prompt hash. Set cache expiration and provide cache hit/miss logic in API request flow.

## 4. Integrate Rate Limiting and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Develop robust error handling and rate limiting logic to gracefully manage API limits, network failures, and unexpected errors.
### Details:
Detect rate limit errors, implement exponential backoff or retry strategies, and display user-friendly error messages. Log errors for debugging and analytics.

## 5. Implement Fallback Descriptions and Offline Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Provide fallback responses or descriptions when the API is unavailable or returns errors, ensuring a seamless user experience.
### Details:
Detect API failures and serve cached or predefined fallback messages. Optionally, allow limited offline functionality with static responses.

## 6. Enable Streaming Responses from OpenAI API [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5
### Description: Integrate support for streaming responses from the OpenAI API, updating the UI in real-time as data arrives.
### Details:
Use supported SDK or WebSocket/WebRTC methods to receive partial responses and update the chat or UI incrementally. Ensure smooth UX and handle stream interruptions.
