# Task ID: 15
# Title: Saved Outfits Functionality Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the ability to save, view, and manage favorite outfit combinations.
# Details:
Create data service for saving outfit combinations to the database. Implement 'Save' functionality with visual feedback. Design Saved Outfits gallery with grid layout. Add outfit categorization and filtering options. Implement outfit deletion with confirmation prompts. Create empty state messaging for new users. Add outfit detail view with item information. Implement data synchronization across devices. Use optimistic updates for improved user experience when saving outfits. Consider implementing offline support for viewing saved outfits without internet connection.

# Test Strategy:
Test saving functionality with various outfit combinations. Verify saved outfits persist across app sessions. Test gallery display with different numbers of saved outfits. Validate deletion functionality removes outfits correctly. Test synchronization across multiple devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Data Service for Persistent Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a robust data service using Expo SQLite or AsyncStorage for saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting user data, ensuring local-first persistence and future sync compatibility.
### Details:
Choose between Expo SQLite for structured data or AsyncStorage for simple key-value pairs. Abstract data operations into a service module following clean code practices. Ensure error handling and asynchronous operations are properly managed.

## 2. Design and Integrate Save UI with Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create user interface components for saving data, providing clear visual feedback (e.g., loading indicators, success/error messages) during save operations.
### Details:
Use React Native best practices for UI feedback. Integrate with the data service to trigger saves and display appropriate feedback based on operation status. Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.

## 3. Develop Gallery Display Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Build a performant gallery view to display saved items, supporting efficient rendering and smooth scrolling for large datasets.
### Details:
Utilize FlatList or SectionList for optimal performance. Fetch data from the data service and render items with thumbnails or previews. Ensure the gallery updates in real-time as data changes.

## 4. Implement Categorization and Filtering Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Enable users to categorize items and filter the gallery view based on categories or search criteria.
### Details:
Add category assignment to the data model. Provide UI controls for selecting categories and entering filter/search terms. Update the gallery display in response to filter changes.

## 5. Enable Item Deletion with Confirmation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Allow users to delete items from the gallery, including confirmation dialogs and UI updates to reflect deletions.
### Details:
Integrate deletion logic with the data service. Show confirmation prompts before deletion. Ensure the gallery updates immediately after an item is deleted.

## 6. Create Detail View for Individual Items [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Develop a detail screen to display full information about a selected item, with options for editing or further actions.
### Details:
Implement navigation from the gallery to the detail view. Fetch and display all relevant item data. Provide edit and action buttons as needed.

## 7. Add Sync and Offline Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Integrate synchronization logic to keep data consistent across devices and support offline usage, using local-first architecture and sync layers.
### Details:
Leverage Expo SQLite or Yjs for local-first data, and implement a sync mechanism (e.g., with a backend or peer-to-peer). Handle conflict resolution and ensure seamless offline/online transitions.
