# Task ID: 19
# Title: Error Handling and Monitoring System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring throughout the application.
# Details:
Integrate error tracking service (Sentry recommended in PRD) for automated error reporting. Implement global error boundary for React components. Create user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions. Implement offline detection and appropriate messaging. Add crash reporting for native exceptions. Create logging service for important application events. Implement performance monitoring for critical operations. Use try-catch patterns consistently throughout the codebase. Consider implementing custom error types for different categories of errors.

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling with various error scenarios. Verify user-friendly messages display correctly. Test offline detection and recovery. Validate error reports contain sufficient information for debugging. Test performance monitoring accurately measures operation times.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Error Tracking Service (e.g., Sentry) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure an error tracking service like Sentry for React Native and Expo to capture and report errors in real time.
### Details:
Install the Sentry SDK, link native dependencies if required, and initialize Sentry in the app entry point. Ensure configuration covers both JavaScript and native errors. Test integration by triggering sample errors and verifying they appear in the Sentry dashboard. Follow Expo and React Native best practices for SDK setup.

## 2. Implement Global Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create and apply global error boundaries to catch unhandled errors at the root and critical component levels.
### Details:
Develop a reusable ErrorBoundary component that logs errors to the tracking service and displays fallback UIs. Wrap the root component and other high-risk components with this boundary. Ensure error boundaries are tested for both synchronous and asynchronous errors.

## 3. Design User-Friendly Error Messages and Fallback UIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Provide clear, actionable, and context-specific error messages and fallback interfaces for users when errors occur.
### Details:
Create UI components for displaying error messages and fallback content. Tailor messages based on error type and context (e.g., network errors, data loading failures). Ensure messages are concise, non-technical, and guide users on possible next steps (e.g., retry, contact support).

## 4. Implement Offline Detection and Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Detect offline status and handle related errors gracefully within the app.
### Details:
Use Expo or React Native APIs to monitor network connectivity. Display appropriate UI when offline, such as banners or modals, and queue actions for retry when connectivity is restored. Integrate offline detection with error boundaries to differentiate between network and other errors.

## 5. Set Up Crash Reporting for Native and JS Errors [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Ensure comprehensive crash reporting for both JavaScript and native code errors.
### Details:
Configure the error tracking service to capture native crashes in addition to JavaScript errors. Test crash reporting by simulating both types of crashes and verifying reports in the dashboard. Document any platform-specific setup required for Expo or bare React Native workflows.

## 6. Integrate Centralized Logging Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Implement a centralized logging solution to record errors, warnings, and key events for debugging and monitoring.
### Details:
Set up a logging utility that sends logs to the error tracking service or a dedicated logging backend. Ensure logs include relevant context (user, device, app state) and are structured for easy querying. Use logging consistently across the app, especially in error boundaries and network handlers.

## 7. Implement Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Add performance monitoring to track app responsiveness, load times, and resource usage.
### Details:
Enable performance monitoring features in the error tracking or analytics service. Track metrics such as app startup time, screen transitions, and network request durations. Set up alerts for performance regressions and visualize trends in the monitoring dashboard.
