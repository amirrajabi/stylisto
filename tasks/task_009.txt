# Task ID: 9
# Title: Supabase Storage Integration for Image Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure image storage using Supabase Storage with proper access controls and CDN configuration.
# Details:
Configure Supabase Storage buckets with appropriate access policies. Implement image upload service that securely transfers images to Supabase Storage. Create image URL generation with CDN support for optimized delivery. Implement storage path structure based on user ID and item type for organized management. Add error handling and retry logic for failed uploads. Configure image transformations for thumbnail generation. Implement cleanup procedures for deleted items. Use Supabase Storage client with proper authentication to ensure secure access.

# Test Strategy:
Test image upload, retrieval, and deletion operations. Verify access controls prevent unauthorized access to user images. Test CDN delivery performance across different regions. Validate error handling for upload failures. Test cleanup procedures for deleted items.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Provision and Secure Storage Bucket [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) with appropriate access controls and encryption to securely store user images.
### Details:
Configure bucket policies for private access, enable server-side encryption, and set up IAM roles or service accounts for secure programmatic access.

## 2. Implement Image Upload Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop a service in the React Native/Expo app to handle image selection, preprocessing, and uploading to the storage bucket.
### Details:
Use Expo's ImagePicker for selection, optionally compress or resize images before upload, and securely upload using pre-signed URLs or authenticated API endpoints.

## 3. Configure CDN for Image Delivery [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Set up a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in front of the storage bucket to serve images efficiently and securely to users.
### Details:
Integrate a CDN (e.g., CloudFront, Cloudflare) with the storage bucket, configure caching rules, and restrict direct bucket access to only the CDN.

## 4. Design Image Path Structuring Scheme [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Define a logical and scalable path structure for storing images in the bucket to support efficient retrieval, organization, and access control.
### Details:
Implement naming conventions using user IDs, timestamps, or UUIDs to avoid collisions and support future scalability.

## 5. Integrate Error Handling and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement robust error detection and retry mechanisms in the upload service to handle network failures, timeouts, and storage errors.
### Details:
Use exponential backoff for retries, provide user feedback on failures, and log errors for monitoring and debugging.

## 6. Implement Image Transformation Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Set up automated image transformations (e.g., resizing, format conversion, thumbnail generation) either on upload or via CDN edge functions.
### Details:
Use serverless functions or CDN features to generate multiple image sizes and formats as needed for different device requirements.

## 7. Develop Cleanup and Lifecycle Management Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.4
### Description: Create automated processes to delete unused images and manage storage lifecycle policies for cost and security optimization.
### Details:
Implement scheduled cleanup scripts, set bucket lifecycle rules for automatic expiration, and ensure compliance with data retention policies.
