# Task ID: 23
# Title: Offline Capability Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 22
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement basic offline functionality to allow viewing saved outfits and wardrobe items without internet connection.
# Details:
Create local storage strategy for critical application data. Implement offline detection and appropriate UI indicators. Add data synchronization when connection is restored. Create offline queue for actions performed while disconnected. Implement conflict resolution for simultaneous changes. Add local caching for frequently accessed images. Create graceful degradation for features requiring online services. Use libraries like Redux Persist or AsyncStorage for offline data persistence. Consider implementing a service worker for advanced caching strategies.

# Test Strategy:
Test application behavior in airplane mode. Verify saved data is accessible offline. Test synchronization when connection is restored. Validate conflict resolution with various scenarios. Test performance with large offline datasets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Local Storage Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Choose and set up a robust local storage solution (e.g., AsyncStorage or SQLite) for persisting app data offline, ensuring compatibility with Expo and React Native best practices.
### Details:
Evaluate storage options (AsyncStorage for simple key-value, SQLite for structured data). Set up the chosen library, define data schemas, and implement CRUD operations for offline data persistence. Ensure data encryption if sensitive information is stored.

## 2. Implement Offline Detection and UI Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Integrate network status detection using Expo's NetInfo and provide clear UI indicators for offline/online states.
### Details:
Use NetInfo to monitor connectivity changes. Display banners, icons, or modals to inform users of offline status. Disable or adjust UI elements that require connectivity, and provide fallback messaging.

## 3. Develop Data Sync Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Create logic to synchronize local data with the remote server when connectivity is restored, handling both upload and download flows.
### Details:
Implement background sync triggers on network reconnection. Use timestamps or versioning to determine changed data. Ensure atomic sync operations and handle partial failures gracefully.

## 4. Build Offline Queue for Mutations [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Queue user actions (e.g., create, update, delete) performed while offline and replay them in order once online.
### Details:
Design a queue structure in local storage for pending mutations. Ensure actions are idempotent and replayed in the correct order. Provide UI feedback for queued actions and their sync status.

## 5. Implement Conflict Resolution Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Handle data conflicts that arise during sync, using strategies such as last-write-wins, user prompts, or merge logic.
### Details:
Detect conflicts based on timestamps or version numbers. Implement automated resolution for simple cases and prompt users for manual resolution when necessary. Log conflicts for debugging and analytics.

## 6. Set Up Image Caching for Offline Access [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Cache images locally to ensure they are available offline, using Expo's FileSystem API or third-party libraries.
### Details:
Intercept image requests and store them in the device's file system. Implement cache invalidation and cleanup strategies. Ensure images are loaded from cache when offline and fallback placeholders are shown if unavailable.

## 7. Ensure Graceful Degradation of Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5, 23.6
### Description: Design the app to degrade gracefully when offline, disabling or modifying features that require connectivity while maintaining core functionality.
### Details:
Audit all app features for network dependencies. Provide alternative flows or informative messaging for features that cannot function offline. Ensure the app remains stable and user-friendly in all network conditions.
