# Task ID: 25
# Title: Deployment Pipeline and Release Preparation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up the continuous integration and deployment pipeline for building and releasing the application.
# Details:
Configure Expo Application Services (EAS) for app building and deployment as specified in the PRD. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and building. Create staging and production environments in Supabase. Implement automated version management and release notes generation. Add code signing for iOS and Android builds. Create App Store and Google Play Store listings with required assets. Implement staged rollout strategy for production releases. Add automated smoke testing post-deployment. Consider implementing feature flags for controlled feature rollout. Use Fastlane for additional automation of deployment processes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and tests the application. Test deployment to staging environment. Validate app builds install correctly on test devices. Test rollback procedures for failed deployments. Verify app store submission process with test submissions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. EAS Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Expo Application Services (EAS) for building and deploying the React Native app.
### Details:
Install Expo CLI and EAS CLI globally. Initialize EAS in the project using 'eas build:configure' to generate the eas.json file. Configure build profiles for development, preview, and production environments. Ensure Expo account is connected and permissions are set.

## 2. CI/CD Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Automate build, test, and deployment processes using a CI/CD pipeline.
### Details:
Integrate with a CI/CD service (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI). Set up workflows to trigger EAS builds on push/merge to main branches. Automate running tests, linting, and static analysis. Configure secrets for Expo tokens and app store credentials.

## 3. Environment Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Manage environment variables and secrets for different deployment stages.
### Details:
Define environment variables for development, staging, and production in app.config.js or using EAS secrets. Use EAS environment variable management to securely store and inject secrets during builds. Document all required variables and their usage.

## 4. Versioning and Release Notes [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2, 25.3
### Description: Implement version control and automate release note generation.
### Details:
Update version and build numbers in app.json or app.config.js as part of the release workflow. Use semantic versioning. Automate release note generation from commit messages or PR descriptions using tools like conventional-changelog. Attach release notes to builds and app store submissions.

## 5. Code Signing [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Set up and manage code signing credentials for iOS and Android builds.
### Details:
Generate or retrieve Apple certificates, provisioning profiles, and Android keystores. Use EAS CLI to upload and manage credentials securely. Automate credential usage in CI/CD workflows. Document credential rotation and backup procedures.

## 6. App Store Listing Preparation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4, 25.5
### Description: Prepare and update app store metadata, assets, and compliance information.
### Details:
Gather and format app icons, screenshots, descriptions, and compliance documents. Use EAS submit or Fastlane to automate metadata uploads. Ensure all required fields are filled and assets meet store guidelines. Review and update privacy policies as needed.

## 7. Staged Rollout Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure staged rollout strategies for gradual app release.
### Details:
Set up phased release in App Store Connect and Google Play Console. Configure EAS update branches for over-the-air (OTA) updates to specific user segments. Monitor rollout progress and set up rollback procedures in case of issues.

## 8. Post-Deployment Testing and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement post-deployment quality assurance and monitoring.
### Details:
Set up crash/error reporting (e.g., Sentry, Bugsee). Monitor app performance and user feedback. Automate smoke tests on production builds. Schedule regular reviews of analytics and error logs to catch regressions early.
