# Task ID: 18
# Title: Analytics and Event Tracking Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement analytics and event tracking to measure user behavior and application performance.
# Details:
Research and select analytics service (Mixpanel or Amplitude recommended in PRD). Implement core analytics events for key user actions (registration, item upload, outfit generation, etc.). Create custom user properties for segmentation analysis. Implement conversion funnels for critical user flows. Add performance monitoring for key operations. Create privacy-compliant data collection with proper user consent. Implement opt-out mechanisms for analytics tracking. Use batch processing for analytics events to minimize network usage. Consider implementing A/B testing framework for feature optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Verify analytics events are triggered for all key user actions. Test user properties are correctly associated with events. Validate privacy compliance with opt-out functionality. Test analytics in offline mode with event queuing. Verify data appears correctly in analytics dashboard.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Select and Integrate Analytics Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research, select, and integrate a suitable analytics service (e.g., Segment, Firebase, UXCam) that is compatible with React Native and Expo. Ensure the SDK is installed and initialized following best practices.
### Details:
Compare analytics providers based on features, privacy, and Expo compatibility. Install the chosen SDK, initialize it in the app entry point, and verify basic connectivity.

## 2. Implement Core Event Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Define and implement tracking for core user events using the analytics SDK. Ensure events are meaningful and aligned with business KPIs.
### Details:
List key user actions (e.g., sign up, purchase, screen view). Use the SDK's track method to log these events at appropriate points in the app. Test event delivery to the analytics dashboard.

## 3. Set Up User Properties and Identification [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Implement user identification and property tracking to associate actions with specific users and their traits.
### Details:
Use the identify method to tie user IDs and traits (e.g., email, plan) to analytics data. Handle both authenticated and anonymous users. Ensure updates are sent when user properties change.

## 4. Design and Track Conversion Funnels [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Define conversion funnels relevant to the app and ensure all funnel steps are tracked as events.
### Details:
Map out key funnels (e.g., onboarding, purchase flow). Ensure each step is tracked as a distinct event. Validate funnel data in the analytics dashboard.

## 5. Implement Privacy Compliance Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Ensure analytics implementation complies with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and provides user controls.
### Details:
Add user consent dialogs, allow opt-out, and document data collection practices. Ensure sensitive data is not tracked and review SDK privacy settings.

## 6. Configure Batch Processing and Data Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Optimize analytics data flow by enabling batch processing and minimizing performance impact.
### Details:
Configure the SDK to batch events where supported. Test for performance and data delivery reliability. Adjust batch size and frequency as needed.
