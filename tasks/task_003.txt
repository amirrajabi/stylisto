# Task ID: 3
# Title: Navigation Architecture Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the tab-based navigation structure with secondary navigation patterns as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Use React Navigation v6 to implement the navigation architecture. Create a bottom tab navigator with four main tabs: Wardrobe, Generate, Saved, and Profile as specified in the PRD. Implement stack navigators within each tab for hierarchical content. Set up modal presentations for focused tasks like adding items or editing preferences. Configure navigation theming to match the design system. Implement consistent back button behavior and navigation patterns. Add deep linking configuration for push notification navigation. Use React Navigation's native stack navigator for optimal performance on both iOS and Android.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation flow between all screens and tabs. Verify that navigation state is preserved when switching between tabs. Test deep linking functionality. Ensure back button behavior is consistent across the application. Validate navigation performance on low-end devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Bottom Tab Navigator [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install necessary navigation libraries and configure a bottom tab navigator as the main navigation structure following Expo and React Navigation best practices.
### Details:
Use @react-navigation/bottom-tabs and ensure the navigator is set as the root. Define initial tabs and configure basic tab options such as icons and labels.

## 2. Implement Stack Navigators for Each Tab [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: For each tab, create a dedicated stack navigator to manage screen transitions within that tab.
### Details:
Use @react-navigation/stack to define stack navigators for each tab. Organize screens logically and ensure navigation between them works as expected.

## 3. Configure Modal Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Set up modal screens that can be presented from any stack or tab, following React Navigation's modal presentation patterns.
### Details:
Define modal routes in a higher-level navigator or use group options for modal presentation. Ensure modals overlay correctly and handle dismissal properly.

## 4. Implement Theming for Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Apply consistent theming to all navigation components, supporting both light and dark modes as per Expo and React Navigation guidelines.
### Details:
Use React Navigation's theming API and Expo's Appearance module to switch themes dynamically. Style tab bars, headers, and modal backgrounds accordingly.

## 5. Handle Back Button Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Implement custom back button behavior for Android and iOS, ensuring correct navigation stack handling and modal dismissal.
### Details:
Use React Navigation's back handling hooks and Expo's BackHandler API. Test edge cases such as nested stacks and modals to prevent unexpected exits.

## 6. Add Deep Linking Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Configure deep linking to allow the app to open specific screens via URLs, supporting both tab and stack navigators.
### Details:
Set up linking configuration in navigation container, define URL patterns for each screen, and test with Expo's linking tools. Ensure correct navigation state restoration from deep links.
